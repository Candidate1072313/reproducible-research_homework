# Reproducible research: version control and R

1) Annotation of the **README.md** file of my logistic growth repository with more complete and detailed information about the analysis. (**10 points**)

   My work can be found **here**: https://github.com/Candidate1072313/logistic_growth/blob/main/README.md
   
3) Using my estimates to calculate the population size at 4980 minutes, assuming exponential growth. I will then compare this to the population size predicted under exponential growth. (**10 points**)

   My work can be found **here**:
5) Addition of an R Script to my repository that compared the exponential and logistic growth curves. (**20 points**)

   My work can be found **here**:
7) Modelling Brownian motion. (**30 points**)

   See the 'question-4-code' folder of this repository.

   **Here** is my code edit in the comparison view:
9) Predicting the size and volume of viral particules from their genome length, and modelling using relevant equations (**30 points**)

   See the 'question-5-code' Posit Cloud section of this repository.

   **Here** is the remainder of my work.
